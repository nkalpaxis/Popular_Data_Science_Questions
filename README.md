# Popular Data Science Questions

In this project, we're going to explore the Data Science Stack Exchange (DSSE) and answer popular data science questions that may arise on the job. The Data Science Stack Exchange is part of Stack Exchange which is a network of question-and-answer websites on topics in diverse fields. All the websites in the network are modeled after the initial site which is very popular among the programming community; Stack Overflow.

We're tasked with finding out "what is the best kind of content to write about". To answer this question, we're going to use the Data Science Stack Exchange's database which is a provided public data base from Stack Exchange
